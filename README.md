# gstreamer-playground

This repo is mainly for code which demonstrates a feature or a bug related to gstreamer in some way.  I use it for communication with devs who are outside my organization.

## Environment variables

`GSTREAMER_1_0_ROOT_X86_64` points to the location where gstreamer is installed.  Property sheets depend on this variable to find the gstreamer libraries and header files.
